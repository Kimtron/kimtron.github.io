<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">❤️❤️❤️Keys? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Right. I haven't Huh?

Leave her alone, you bastard. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. George. George. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. The hell you doing to my car?

Thank you. In about thirty years. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. You're George McFly. Lorraine. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Erased from existence. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Ahh.
